# Bred üí∏üçû  
Bred is the ultimate financial management platform for your organization, designed to streamline expense tracking across projects, visualize spending patterns with dynamic charts, and provide actionable insights to make data-driven decisions effortlessly.  

Bred was built using ReactJS, Express.js, [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorUkyfvfqBEhL0ITYdPJ3b4o98voV-nNfbKw9CjwKkZ0UQLnePK), and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (a simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for the modern web).

## Motivation  
Bred began as a side project to explore ReactJS, evolving into a dynamic blend of ReactJS and Express.js as new features and data-handling requirements shaped its development. Additionally, I wanted to explore the use of various CSS frameworks to create consistent, appealing, and responsive user interfaces.  
Chart.js was leveraged to create dynamic and interactive charts for Bred, combining its simplicity with powerful built-in chart types such as scatter plots, line charts, and pie charts, ensuring seamless data visualization.
